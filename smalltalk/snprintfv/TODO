* namespace
** decide whether it is fine to override the printf functions
in the C library instead of prefixing them with snv_

* performance
** move handling of limit (and possibly buffering?) to the single
streams.  This would give better performance and possibly turn
stream_put into a macro that just dispatches to the put_func.

* modules
** the printf_load_module_callback i/face is kludgy: there
is no provision to load only dlpreloaded modules (perhaps
the loader field in lt_dlhandle_struct should be moved into
lt_dlinfo so that the validation callback can decide?)

* documentation
** Write the non-generated docs with an examples of:
*** custom streams
*** dynamic loading

* easy integration
** wrap up an autoconf macro so that snprintfv can be distributed
without the overhead of a subconfigure (see how we use libltdl for
an example).
