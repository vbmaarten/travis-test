This directory implements a C preprocessor. It does not have error
handling but it should mostly work.

Several files are the beginning of a parser for C header files.
It is broken and it lacks several important parts of the grammar
(it was probably test code already in 1.1.5).  If you want to take
a look at it, you're welcome.
